# PowerShellScripts
A collection of PowerShell Scripts I've written to support my role as a Systems Administrator.

The Scripts included are:

1. Single User Creation - Including a random password generator & a text file output to be given to the user during their induction period.
2. Bulk User Creation from a CSV - Same as the above but allowing to create multiple users at once. Each user gets their own text file output.
